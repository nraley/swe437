Hand in for Assignment 3

Documentation Log:
Nathan began work on the program by adding in skeleton methods for us to fill in later.
Gabriel then went through and removed the redundancy within the conversion methods and added a way to handle precision for the output.
Michael followed that by consolidating the conversion functions together.


Description of new UI:
The overall UI has not changed.
A few new lines of output and required inputs have been added.
These ask the user for how much precision they want on their next conversion.


Maintainability Assessment:
Due to all the redundancy created and left behind by the original programmers, there was a lot that had to be cleaned up.
Likewise, we had created spaces and functions in our previous version that needed to be altered.
While we knew we would have to change it, it did lead to some problems due to us not having settled on a clear coding convention.

On the other side, due to how much was repeated, it was easy to figure out what could be safely removed without altering the intended functionality.
Similarily, on our side, we had things laid out rather clearly in the program space so finding areas to add things in was easy.

In the future, we could have settled on a clear coding convention beforehand so speed up readability.
We could also add comments and whitespace around areas that do specific things (ie. this prints the menu, this reads input, etc.).
