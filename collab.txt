Collaboration Summary:

Nelson Raley
Gabriel Bartholom√§us
Michael Pham

Nelson Raley separated the frontend webapp code from the backend, and created the core new UI by creating a menu for the conversions using a switch statement which selects a conversion and converts the entered value using the selected conversion. He also got the documentation log started and recorded the troubles regarding the methods not being static.
Gabriel Bartholomaus and Michael Pham worked together to get the new UI functioning as a continual loop that allows the user to enter many more inputs and testing to make sure the UI did not crash under normal inputs.
Nelson wrote most of the documentation log, Gabriel wrote most of UI description, and Michael wrote most of the maintainability assessment.
