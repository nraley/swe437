Version 1.1 Collaboration Summary:

Gabriel Bartholomaus removed the redundant rounding code and added a method that allowed for rounding to be handled once with the precision specified by the user.
Michael Pham refactored the convertX2Y() methods to eliminate as much duplicated functionality as possible, added new conversions between miles per hour and kilometers per hour, updated the menu, added precision level 0, and changed some small things to make things more maintainable.
