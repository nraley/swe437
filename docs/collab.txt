Version 1.2 Collaboration Summary:

Gabriel Bartholomäus added Junit functionality to the project, created a makefile to make compiling and running Junit test easier.
Following that, he update the main Conversion class to handle non-int inputs and helped with developing the Junit tests.

Michael Pham answered part 2 of assignment 4 about the JUnit test flaw.
Following that, he also helped with the JUnit tests for Conversion.class by adding test inputs.

Nelson Raley participated in discussion with Michael and Gabriel in solving the Part 2 problem.
He also worked on generating tests for null and unexpected input tests for unit conversion before we realized this was a moot point due to compiler intervention.
