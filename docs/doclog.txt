Hand in for Assignment 5

User stories:

    mph<->kpl: I want to buy a car from a European site, Its gas mileage is in KPL but I'm American, so I use MPG.

    k<->C: I'm on a scientific webpage and I don't understand kelvin, but I understand celsius.

    For both cases, I want to be able to enter a value, and then choose precision between 1-4 decimal places.

Testing:

    MPG to KPL TDD log:
        Iteration 1:
            Test: For starters, we just want to test conversion in one direction, so we're starting with MPG to KPL. We assume that another conversion option has been created in the switch statement used to decide conversion, and expect the proper result.
            Refactor: We first add another conversion option in our convertUnits() switch statement: case 17. Then, fill in the proper conversion.
